"Deme {pop1}, initially with {size1} individuals, ceased to exist {time1} generations ago and split into two new demes: {pop2} starting with {size2} and {pop3} with {size3}. By {time2}, there was a pulse of admixture from {pop2} to {pop3} at proportion {proportion1}, and both populations have maintained their sizes since that event."
"Initially comprising {size1} individuals, {pop1} ended {time1} generations ago, giving rise to {pop2} and {pop3} with sizes {size2} and {size3}, respectively. At {time2}, a single admixture event occurred, with {pop2} contributing to {pop3} in the proportion {proportion1}. Since then, both demes have remained the same size."
"Starting with {size1} individuals, {pop1} was terminated {time1} generations ago and resulted in the formation of two demes, {pop2} and {pop3}, with respective sizes of {size2} and {size3}. A pulse of admixture from {pop2} to {pop3} happened at {time2} in the proportion {proportion1}, and the sizes of these demes have been constant thereafter."
"From an initial population of {size1}, {pop1} dissolved {time1} generations ago, leading to the creation of {pop2} and {pop3} with sizes {size2} and {size3}. An admixture pulse from {pop2} to {pop3} occurred at {time2} with the proportion {proportion1}, and the sizes of both demes have been preserved since then."
"With {size1} individuals initially, {pop1} concluded its existence {time1} generations ago, birthing {pop2} and {pop3} with sizes {size2} and {size3}. At {time2}, there was a pulse of genetic admixture from {pop2} to {pop3} using proportion {proportion1}, and their sizes have not changed since."
"At its beginning, {pop1} had {size1} individuals but terminated {time1} generations ago, splitting into {pop2} and {pop3} with initial sizes of {size2} and {size3}. At {time2}, a significant admixture pulse from {pop2} to {pop3} occurred at a proportion {proportion1}, after which both demes have maintained steady sizes."
"Originally housing {size1} individuals, {pop1} ceased {time1} generations ago, leading to the emergence of {pop2} with {size2} and {pop3} with {size3}. A subsequent admixture event from {pop2} to {pop3} at {time2} using proportion {proportion1} has since kept the sizes of both demes constant."
"{pop1} started with {size1} individuals and was terminated {time1} generations ago, subsequently creating {pop2} and {pop3} with sizes {size2} and {size3}. At {time2}, an admixture pulse was introduced from {pop2} to {pop3} at proportion {proportion1}, and the sizes of these demes have been static since that point."
"Beginning with a population of {size1}, {pop1} was dissolved {time1} generations ago, generating {pop2} with {size2} and {pop3} with {size3}. There was a pulse of admixture from {pop2} to {pop3} at {time2} with the proportion {proportion1}, and since then, the sizes of both demes have not altered."
"With an initial population of {size1}, {pop1} expired {time1} generations ago and gave rise to two new demes, {pop2} with {size2} and {pop3} with {size3}. An admixture event took place at {time2} from {pop2} to {pop3} at proportion {proportion1}, and the sizes of these demes have been unchanged since that time."

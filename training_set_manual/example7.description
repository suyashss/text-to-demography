Deme {pop1} had an intial size of {size1}. At {time1} generations ago, it gave rise to demes {pop2} and {pop3} and terminated. The intial size of {pop2} was {size2} and that for {pop3} was {size3}. There were migrations between the two populations, first from {pop2} to {pop3} at rate {rate1} from {time1} generation ago to {time2}, then from {pop3} to {pop2} at rate {rate2} from {time3} generation ago to {time4}, and finally from {pop2} to {pop3} at rate {rate3} from {time5} generations ago to present time.

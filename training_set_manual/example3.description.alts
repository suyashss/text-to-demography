"The {pop1} deme's size was {size1} until {time1} generations ago, when it began a {changetype1} {size1_to_size2_description_present} through to {time2}.

"Up to {time1} generations ago, the population of the {pop1} deme was steady at {size1}. It then entered a phase of {changetype1} {size1_to_size2_description_present} until {time2}.

"The {pop1} deme held its population size constant at {size1} until {time1} generations ago, then experienced a {changetype1} {size1_to_size2_description_present} up to {time2}. This was followed by an {changetype2} {size2_to_size3_description_present}, resulting in {size3} individuals by {time3}. From {time3} generations onward to the present, the population has been on a {changetype3} {size3_to_size4_description_present} from {size3} to {size4}."
"For the {pop1} deme, the population size remained at {size1} until {time1} generations ago, at which point a {changetype1} {size1_to_size2_description_present} took place until {time2}.

"Until {time1} generations ago, the {pop1} deme's population was fixed at {size1}. From {time1} to {time2}, it underwent a {changetype1} {size1_to_size2_description_present} to {size2} individuals. Then, a {changetype2} {size2_to_size3_description_present} brought the count to {size3} by {time3}. Since then, from {time3} generations to the current day, the population has {size3_to_size4_description} from {size3} to {size4} at a {changetype3} rate."
"The deme of {pop1} kept its population at {size1} until {time1} generations ago, when a {changetype1} {size1_to_size2_description_present} ensued until {time2}. Subsequently, a {changetype2} {size2_to_size3_description_present} changed the numbers to {size3} individuals by {time3}.

"Up until {time1} generations ago, the population of {pop1} deme was constant at {size1}. It then entered a {changetype1} phase of {size1_to_size2_description_present} until {time2}. This was succeeded by an {changetype2} phase of {size2_to_size3_description_present}, leading to {size3} by {time3}. From {time3} generations to present, the population has {size3_to_size4_description} from {size3} to {size4} {changetype3}ly."
"The population size of {pop1} deme stood at {size1} until a shift at {time1} generations ago, leading to a {changetype1} {size1_to_size2_description_present} up to {time2}. Following this, there was an {changetype2} {size2_to_size3_description_present} to {size3} individuals by {time3}. Since {time3}, the population has seen a {changetype3} {size3_to_size4_description} from {size3} to {size4}, continuing to the current time."
"Initially, the {pop1} deme's population count was {size1} until {time1} generations ago, at which point it began a {changetype1} {size1_to_size2_description_present} until reaching {time2}.

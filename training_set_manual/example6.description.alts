"Deme {pop1}, initially having {size1} individuals, and deme {pop2}, starting with {size2} individuals, merged {time1} generations ago in proportions {proportion1} and {proportion2} respectively, forming {pop3} which then had a constant size of {size3}, after which {pop2} ceased to exist."
"Initially, {pop1} had {size1} individuals and {pop2} had {size2}. {time1} generations ago, they amalgamated in ratios {proportion1} for {pop1} and {proportion2} for {pop2} to create {pop3}, maintaining a steady population of {size3}, subsequently leading to the discontinuation of {pop2}."
"Starting with {size1} individuals in {pop1} and {size2} in {pop2}, the two demes blended {time1} generations before the present with respective proportions {proportion1} and {proportion2}, giving rise to {pop3} with a consistent size of {size3}, after which point {pop2} was terminated."
"With initial populations of {size1} in {pop1} and {size2} in {pop2}, the two combined {time1} generations ago at proportions {proportion1} for {pop1} and {proportion2} for {pop2}, resulting in the formation of {pop3} with a stable population of {size3}, followed by the cessation of {pop2}."
"{pop1}, with its {size1} individuals, and {pop2}, with {size2} individuals, converged {time1} generations ago in the ratios of {proportion1} and {proportion2} to form {pop3}, which then sustained a fixed size of {size3}, after which {pop2} was discontinued."
"Beginning with {size1} individuals in {pop1} and {size2} individuals in {pop2}, the demes merged {time1} generations before now, using proportions {proportion1} for {pop1} and {proportion2} for {pop2}, to establish {pop3}, which has since maintained a size of {size3}, and led to the termination of {pop2}."
"At the outset, {pop1} contained {size1} individuals, and {pop2} contained {size2}. {time1} generations ago, they unified in proportions {proportion1} and {proportion2}, creating {pop3} with a constant population of {size3}, after which {pop2} was disbanded."
"{pop1}, beginning with {size1} individuals, and {pop2}, with {size2}, fused {time1} generations ago at proportions {proportion1} for {pop1} and {proportion2} for {pop2}, producing {pop3} with a steadfast size of {size3}, and subsequently, {pop2} was phased out."
"Originating with {size1} individuals in {pop1} and {size2} in {pop2}, these demes admixed {time1} generations ago at proportions {proportion1} to {pop1} and {proportion2} to {pop2}, leading to the creation of {pop3} with a uniform size of {size3}, following which {pop2} ended."
"Commencing with {size1} individuals in {pop1} and {size2} in {pop2}, the demes merged in the proportions of {proportion1} for {pop1} and {proportion2} for {pop2} {time1} generations before the present, forming {pop3} with a consistent population of {size3}, after which {pop2} came to an end."

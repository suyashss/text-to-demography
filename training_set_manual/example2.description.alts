"Until {time1} generations ago, the population of deme {pop1} was {size1}. At that point, it {size1_to_size2_description} to {size2}, where it has stayed up to now."
"{pop1} deme's population was steady at {size1} before it {size1_to_size2_description} to {size2} {time1} generations ago, maintaining that number to the present."
"The population of deme {pop1} held at {size1} until {time1} generations back, when it {size1_to_size2_description} reaching {size2}, which has been constant since then."
"For deme {pop1}, the population count was {size1} until a change {time1} generations ago, where it {size1_to_size2_description} to {size2}, remaining steady thereafter."
"Originally, deme {pop1} had a population size of {size1}, which {size1_to_size2_description} to {size2} around {time1} generations ago and has not changed since."
"Up until {time1} generations ago, the count of {pop1} deme was {size1}. Following that period, it {size1_to_size2_description} to {size2}, where it has persisted until now."
"Deme {pop1} maintained a population of {size1} until there was a shift {time1} generations ago that {size1_to_size2_description} its numbers to {size2}, a figure that has remained the same since."
"The number of individuals in deme {pop1} remained at {size1} until {time1} generations ago, at which time it {size1_to_size2_description} to a new stable size of {size2}."
"Initially, the population size of deme {pop1} stood at {size1}, but this changed {time1} generations ago when it {size1_to_size2_description} to {size2}, and it has been stable at that size up to today."
"Until a shift occurred {time1} generations ago, deme {pop1}'s population was consistently {size1}. Since then, it {size1_to_size2_description} to {size2}, a number that has remained unchanged to the current time."

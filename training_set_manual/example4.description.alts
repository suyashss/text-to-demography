"{pop1} deme initially had {size1} individuals. {time1} generations ago, it divided into two separate demes: {pop2} carrying {size2} individuals and {pop3} with {size3} individuals, and these numbers have stayed constant up to now."
"Initially, deme {pop1} consisted of {size1} individuals. Around {time1} generations ago, it split, forming {pop2} with a population of {size2} and {pop3} with a population of {size3}, both of which have maintained these sizes to the present."
"Starting off with {size1} individuals, deme {pop1} bifurcated {time1} generations ago into two demes: {pop2} with {size2} individuals and {pop3} with {size3} individuals, with no change in their sizes since then."
"{pop1} deme, originally comprising {size1} individuals, underwent a division {time1} generations ago, resulting in demes {pop2} and {pop3}, having {size2} and {size3} individuals respectively, which remained unchanged till now."
"With an initial count of {size1} individuals, {pop1} deme divided into two, {pop2} and {pop3}, with populations of {size2} and {size3} respectively, {time1} generations ago, and these populations have stayed the same since."
"{pop1} deme, initially housing {size1} individuals, split into {pop2} and {pop3} with {size2} and {size3} individuals respectively, {time1} generations before the present, and these numbers have remained stable up to the current time."
"Beginning with a population of {size1} individuals, {pop1} deme split {time1} generations ago into demes {pop2} and {pop3}, with populations of {size2} and {size3}, respectively, which have not changed since."
"{pop1} deme, which initially contained {size1} individuals, separated into {pop2} and {pop3}, with population sizes of {size2} and {size3} respectively, {time1} generations back, and has maintained these sizes to this day."
"Originally home to {size1} individuals, {pop1} deme divided into two populations, {pop2} with {size2} individuals and {pop3} with {size3} individuals, {time1} generations ago, and these population sizes have remained constant."
"Deme {pop1} initially populated by {size1} individuals, branched out into {pop2} and {pop3} demes with {size2} and {size3} individuals respectively, {time1} generations back, with their sizes remaining unchanged up to the present."

The AFR population had a size of 7310.0 until 5920 generations ago. At that point, its size increased to 144740.0. It remained constant at that size till 204.6 generations in the past. Since that time, it has grown exponentially to a present size of 432124.58438330283 . The EUR population started 2040.0 generations ago with the AFR deme as ancestor, and starting size 1861.0 until 920.0 generations before now. At 920.0 generations ago, its size decreased to 1032.0. However, after that it grew exponentially, reaching a size of 9279.212349452768 by 204.6 generations before present. Between 204.6 generations and now, its size has increased from 9279.212349452768 to 501436.3434585535 at an exponential rate.

There was migration from AFR to EUR at rate 0.00015 until 920.0 generations ago, and migration from EUR to AFR at the same rate until 920.0 generations ago. Since 920.0 generations in the past, the migration rate from AFR to EUR has changed to 2.5e-05, and the same for EUR to AFR.

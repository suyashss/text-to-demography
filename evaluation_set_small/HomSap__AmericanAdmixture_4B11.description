The ancestral population started with a size of 7310 and went extinct 5920 generations before present. The AMH population was derived from the ancestral population, with a starting size of 14474, starting 5920 generations before current time. It ended 2040 generations ago. The AMH population gave rise to the OOA deme, whose starting size was 1861, and it persisted until 920 generations ago. The AFR deme was also derived from the AMH, with a starting size of 14474 and it continues till modern times. The EUR population was derived from OOA 920 generations ago. From an initial size of 1000, it continued to grow at an exponential rate, with size 34039 at present time. The ancestor of the EAS population was OOA, and it grew exponentially from a starting size of 510 to a modern size of 45852. The ADMIX deme originated from the AFR, EUR, and EAS populations, and the admixture proportions were 0.167 for AFR, 0.333 for EUR, and 0.5 for EAS. It started 12 generations before present with a size of 30000, and its population size is growing exponentially, with a current size of 54664. 

There was migration between the AFR and OOA at rate 15e-5, between AFR and EUR at rate 2.5e-5, between AFR and EAS at rate 0.78e-5, and between EUR and EAS at rate 3.11e-5 .

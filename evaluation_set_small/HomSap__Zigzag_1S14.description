The generic population has an initial size of 7156. Then its size oscillates between 7156 and 71560, growing exponentially from 7156 at 34133.31 generations to 71560 at 8533.33. It decreases exponentially again to 7156 by 2133.33. It increases exponentially from 2133.33 generations to 533.33 generations, reaching 71560. It reduces to 7156 by 133.33 generations at an exponential rate. Then it grows to 71560 by 33.333 generations, and remains at that size till modern times.
